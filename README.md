# TODO
- Fix dune build (dev/prod profiles, optimise js_of_ocaml and ocamlc flags even of intermediate files, ocamlformat)
- Test (?)
- Update js_of_ocaml for new bigarray conversions
- Ensure good propagation of exceptions throughout reactml/reactjs/webworker/lwt
- Handle the case of corrupted cache/indexeddb
- constrain the dependencies (with >=)
- Find a better pattern than `?signal ?signal ?signal` in `Reactjs`
